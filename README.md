# Building an Online RPG Game Using React Hooks Part 1

## Episode #34 - Implementing a walking character using a custom React Hook

We will be using a hook from https://github.com/donavon/use-event-listener, and the built in React Hooks API functions, useState, and useEffect, to animate our character sprite to simulate walking. You will learn what a sprite is, how they are used, and of course, how to build some functional, modern React components, and how to build and use your own custom React Hooks.

To get started download the example code from ...

- `git clone https://github.com/ReactUniversity/034-building-an-online-rpg-game-part-1`
- `git checkout 01-start-here`

And follow along with the screencast. The completed code for this episode can be found on the "done" branch.
